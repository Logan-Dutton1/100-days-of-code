# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 18, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: I became aquainted with Sublime Text and CoCalc. Also, I started working on a program to solve Problem #1 on Project Euler.  

**Thoughts:** Good first day! I and very new to programming and jumping into Project Euler problems right off the bat is a bit overwhelming. However, I love a good challenge. 

**Link to work:** I haven't found a mode to display snpahots of my code yet. Will keep working on this. Hopefully I will have links up by Day 3.  

### Day 2: May 19, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Worked on Project Euler Problem #1  

**Thoughts:** These problems are really hard for me. I have a weak math background. I am glad that I started out with this problem though. It has given me the motivation to study higher level math and improve my problem solving abilities.

### Day 3: May 20, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Started building a program to find specific data in text. 

**Thoughts:** I found this exercise in a book. Along the way, I got an idea to eventually take this concept to a lager scale.  I would like to build a program that will pull key passages out of research articles.

### Day 4: May 21, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Started a Tutorial Project using Optical Character Recognition. 

**Thoughts:** I have to say, I am really really excited to build something involving OCR. 

**Link to work:** N/A I am not sure if I can post tutorial projects in GitHub. Need to learn copyright policies for coding. 

### Day 5: May 22, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Continued working on tutorial project from previous day, 

**Thoughts:** I am having an issue getting Angular CLI to run on my computer. I am actively looking into the issue, but I am not sure exactly why this is happening. I might have to circular back to this project at a later date.

### Day 6: May 23, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: I did not code today. I was not feeling well.

**Thoughts:** N/A

**Link to work:**  N/A

### Day 7: May 24, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: I worked on a Python Tutorial. I am about half way done 

**Thoughts:** For quite a bit, I have been torn as to what type of tech career I want to pursue. I have narrowed it down to AI/ML/Data Science/FinTech. With that being said, it made sense to spend my coding time studying and building Python projects.

**Link to work:** N/A

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 18, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: I became aquainted with Sublime Text and CoCalc. Also, I started working on a program to solve Problem #1 on Project Euler.  

**Thoughts:** Good first day! I and very new to programming and jumping into Project Euler problems right off the bat is a bit overwhelming. However, I love a good challenge. 

**Link to work:** I haven't found a mode to display snpahots of my code yet. Will keep working on this. Hopefully I will have links up by Day 3.  

### Day 2: May 19, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Worked on Project Euler Problem #1  

**Thoughts:** These problems are really hard for me. I have a weak math background. I am glad that I started out with this problem though. It has given me the motivation to study higher level math and improve my problem solving abilities.

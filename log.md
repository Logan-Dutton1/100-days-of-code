# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 18, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: I became aquainted with Sublime Text and CoCalc. Also, I started working on a program to solve Problem #1 on Project Euler.  

**Thoughts:** Good first day! I and very new to programming and jumping into Project Euler problems right off the bat is a bit overwhelming. However, I love a good challenge. 

**Link to work:** I haven't found a mode to display snpahots of my code yet. Will keep working on this. Hopefully I will have links up by Day 3.
